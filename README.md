# Object Detection using YOLOv4!

We'll be using Scaled YoloV4 algorithm, for performing object-detection throught our webcam.

**YOLO** - **Y**ou **O**nly **L**ook **O**nce is one of the mostly used state of the art object detection algorithm which is premilinary being trained on COCO dataset.

Why it is named as such?
- The detection happens through one single-pass, single forward pass which enables it be outperforming most of the already existing object detection algorithms.
- However, it's quite debatable in some sense, that in some of the scenarios, we see there are few which perform better. Thereby, we can fairly state that it depends on what scene we are working on, and based on our objective, we need to decide which algorithm we must implement and somehow make a good bargain out of it and quite experimental.

We'll be using the specific **YoloV4-csp-640X640** algorithm, which is considered as one of the fastest and the most accurate object detection existing till present.
